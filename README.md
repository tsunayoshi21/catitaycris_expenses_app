This is a personal project made with love by [@csierr](https://github.com/csierr) and [@tsunayoshi21](https://github.com/tsunayoshi21). We built it mainly for our own entertainment, learning, and to challenge ourselves a little bit.

Our app is open source and anyone is welcome to use it, fork it, or contribute if it’s useful for you! Right now, it’s tailored for our own needs and only supports parsing emails from **Banco de Chile**. Expanding support for other banks is a fun challenge we hope to tackle soon.

We see this project as a living proof-of-concept (POC) and a space to experiment, so expect things to change and improve over time. If you’re curious, passionate about finance, or just want to play with some code, you’re in the right place.
